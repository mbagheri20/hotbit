# Hotbit 
Hotbit is an ASE density-functional tight-binding calculator that aims to provide
* an open-source DFTB code
* a handy companion for DFT (for easy & fast electronic structure analysis, for quick access to dynamical properties for testing, and for playing around)
* a compact and accessible code for everyone to inspect and modify (avoiding parallelization implies that the code is less suitable for large systems)
* an intuitive user interface (ideal for learning and teaching realistic electronic structure simulations)
* DFTB parametrization suite including interface to _libxc_ (see further instructions below)

## environment variables
When installing with
```
python setup.py install --home=.
```
you can set the necessary environment variables by calling
```
bash env_exports
```

## LibXC interface:
_LibXC_ can be found at [https://libxc.gitlab.io/](https://libxc.gitlab.io/)
* For using the Hotbit Slater-Koster parametrization suite together with exchange-correlation functionals from _libxc_, you should install _libxc_ and its python module. For details on the installation, please refer to the instructions given with the _libxc_ package.
Currently, Hotbit supports LDA and GGA functionals (meta-GGAs and hybrids pending)
Specification of functionals is supported via their generic names. For a list of available functionals, please refer to
```
hotbit.parametrization.pylibxc_functionals.py
```
Support of direct specification via _libxc_ identifiers will be added soon.
